Xception Architecture to classify species and genera of bacteria. a 5-Fold cross validation was used to validate the performance of the model, An average of 99.71% accuracy has been achieved, competing and even beating published State-of-The-Art models. The Keras library was used with Tensorflow backend.\n

The accuracy of the folds..
|Fold|Validation accuracy (%)|
|---|---|
|Fold-1 |99.28%|
|Fold-2 |99.28%|
|Fold-3 |100%|
|Fold-4 |100%|
|Fold-5 |100%|
| Average|99.71%|


This project made use of the Digital Image of Bacterial Species, found here: http://misztal.edu.pl/software/databases/dibas/ . There are 33 classes of bacteria with around 20 examples each. A copy of the dataset has been uploaded to google drive; can be found here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BlLxXkBJyz3nJojqsFmztc-SngMdFF4J?usp=sharing
